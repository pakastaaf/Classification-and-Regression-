MAIN CODE - prediction-classification.ipynb - the code for classification of data (models LOGISTIC REGRESSION, GBM, RANDOM FOREST, SVM, KNN are used and compared by using different metrics such as MSE, r2), here the medical expenses are predicted and classified.


MAIN CODE - prediction-regression.ipynb - the code for regression data (models Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression are used to predict the SalePrice (price of houses) column and also are compared using the metrics.
